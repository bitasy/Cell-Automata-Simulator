The Add Simulation button creates a new window that allows the user to select their own simulation and their own sliders. This allows the user to customize their view to their own specifications. Change the speed, have their own simulations, etc. All of this is easily implemented with new windows. Sectioning off the display for multiple simulations has a lot of problems. Resizing a lof of the different simulations in a reasonable and elegant way is unrealistic. With potentially multiple views and different shaped simulations, it could look pretty gross to section off the display.
